# THE HACKER'S NOTES

## The Hacker's Notes is where the real notes live.

This is the working notebook behind Hackers Notes: [All Tech. No Theory-Execution](https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Notes-All-Tech-Theory-Execution/dp/B0F5ZGFK1B/). Same mindset, less noise. Things you can run, test, tweak, and move on with.<br>

I’m Kayemba Hamiidu (Hamcodes). I build things, break things, teach what matters, and ignore the rest. I share tools, shortcuts, and lessons learned the hard way.<br>

If you’re here to actually do the work and not just read about it, you’re good.
